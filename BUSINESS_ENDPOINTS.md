# Business Endpoints Documentation

## Overview

These specialized endpoints extend the basic CRUD functionality with complex business logic specific to the agro B2B platform. Each endpoint handles specific workflows with proper validation, role-based access control, and audit logging.

## üè≠ **Approvisionnement Workflow** (`/api/approvisionnements/workflow`)

### **Purpose**
Handles the complete supply chain workflow from supplier proposal to stock reception.

### **Workflow Steps**
1. **Supplier** creates approvisionnement (status: `pending`)
2. **Business Developer** validates/rejects (status: `validated_bd` / `rejected`)
3. **Stock Manager** receives/rejects physical stock (status: `received` / `rejected`)

### **Available Actions**
- `validate_bd` - Business Developer validates approvisionnement
- `reject_bd` - Business Developer rejects approvisionnement
- `receive_stock` - Stock Manager receives physical stock
- `reject_stock` - Stock Manager rejects physical stock

### **Business Rules**
- Only Business Developers can validate/reject approvisionnements
- Only Stock Managers can receive/reject physical stock
- When stock is received, inventory is automatically updated
- Payment to supplier is triggered when stock is received
- All actions are logged for audit trail

### **Example Usage**
```json
POST /api/approvisionnements/workflow
{
  "approvisionnement_id": "uuid",
  "action": "validate_bd",
  "notes": "Product quality meets standards"
}
```

## üìù **Testing**

Each endpoint can be tested using the following pattern:

1. **Authentication**: Ensure user is logged in
2. **Role Validation**: Verify user has correct role
3. **Data Validation**: Test with valid and invalid data
4. **Business Logic**: Verify business rules are enforced
5. **Audit Trail**: Check that actions are properly logged

### **Test Examples**

```bash
# Test Approvisionnement Workflow
curl -X POST /api/approvisionnements/workflow \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"approvisionnement_id":"uuid","action":"validate_bd"}'

# Test Order Processing
curl -X POST /api/orders/process \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"client_id":"user-id","warehouse_id":"uuid","items":[...]}'

# Test Stock Management
curl -X POST /api/stocks/management \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer token" \
